## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the Valentine invitation letter into a single cohesive heartfelt English letter of ~500 words while keeping “Will you be my Valentine?” as the prominent final call-to-action line.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current short letter body text with a romantic, cohesive English letter totaling approximately 450–550 words (excluding the final “Will you be my Valentine?” line).
- Ensure the existing animated line/letter reveal continues to work without layout issues or missing text.
- Keep the final main question text exactly “Will you be my Valentine?” and maintain its visual prominence.

**User-visible outcome:** The Valentine letter displays a longer heartfelt message (~500 words) that reveals with the existing animation and ends with a prominent “Will you be my Valentine?” prompt.
