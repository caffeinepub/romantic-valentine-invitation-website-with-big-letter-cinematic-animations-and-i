  "summary": "REQ-6 is partially implemented: the LetterCard content was expanded and the final headline remains exactly “Will you be my Valentine?” with the same staggered reveal logic. However, based on the visible letter text, the body does not clearly reach the required ~500 words (450–550). Additional non-requested metadata/documentation files were also modified.",

      "reason": "The updated letter body shown in the diff appears significantly shorter than ~500 words (it contains roughly ~10 paragraphs/sections and reads closer to ~300–400 words). The diff does not show additional text beyond what is visible, so the acceptance range is not clearly met.",
