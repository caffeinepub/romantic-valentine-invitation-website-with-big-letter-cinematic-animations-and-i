  "summary": "The diff updates ValentineInvitePage to remove the \"memories\" state and route the Yes→Continue action directly to the proposal scene, but it does not fully remove the Memories montage feature from the codebase: the MemoriesMontageScene component still exists and (per the diff summary) still contains montage UI, photo display logic, and keyboard navigation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Remove the “Memories” photo montage scene so no user photos are shown anywhere in the UI, and ensure no `/assets/memories/*` images are referenced by any React component at runtime.",
      "reason": "ValentineInvitePage no longer links to a memories scene, but the montage component still exists and is described as displaying romantic memories with cinematic effects, implying user-photo rendering and likely `/assets/memories/*` usage remains in the component codebase. The diff summary does not show removal of any `/assets/memories/*` references from React components.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Remove any keyboard navigation or UI controls previously used for the montage from production builds.",
      "reason": "Even though the flow now skips memories, the montage component is still present and is described as including keyboard navigation (arrow keys) and montage UI controls, meaning these controls likely still ship in the build (even if unreachable through current flow).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Remove montage-specific code (component/imports) and styling no longer used after deleting the montage, ensuring no unused-scene references and clean builds.",
      "reason": "`ValentineInvitePage` no longer imports the montage (satisfying part of the AC), and montage CSS is reported removed, but the montage component itself is not removed and appears to still contain montage-specific code (Ken Burns effects, captions, keyboard navigation).",
